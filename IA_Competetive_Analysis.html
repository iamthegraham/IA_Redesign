  	<h1>Information Architecture Redesign</h1>
	<h2>Competetive Analysis</h2>
	<div class="bodypara"><p>5 sites were chosen and analyzed: Yale, Boston University (BU), Rutgers University (RU), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and University of Notre Dame (ND). Sites were chosen by viewing several lists of "Best University Web Pages" and selectively choosing a few. Click through each link for the raw data breakdown of the organization of the sites primary navigation.
	</P>
	<br/><a href="images/BU_CA.png">Boston University</a>
	<br/><a href="images/RU_CA.png">Rutgers University</a>
	<br/><a href ="images/MIT_CA.png">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>
	<br/><a href="images/YALE_CA.png">Yale</a>
	<br/><a href="images/ND_CA.png">Notre Dame</a>
	<p>All five sites organized their primary navigation by task, not by user type, though BU had an additional navigational element for user type.  Every site also had a dedicated news and/or events section on the homepage to spotlight goings on at the university, rather than necessitating a "News" tab on primary navigation (though RU did both). Four of them had an embedded search form on the home page, and two had a site map in the footer</p>
	</div>

	<img class="imagic" src="images/nd_footer.jpg"></img>
	<br/>
	<p class="caption">Notre Dame's footer included a sitemap, which helped the navigability of the site.</p>
	<br/>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>These were the most common topics of primary navigation on each site, with the most common secondary elements listed as well:</p>
	</div>
	<img class="imagic" src="images/primary_nav.png"></img>
	<br/>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>Every page had an Admissions and About tab, so these were obvious inclusions. Most had an Academics/Education tab, a Research tab,  a Global tab, and a Donations tab. Other elements on more than one site were Campus Life, Athletics, some sort of "Faculty" portal, and a tab for the local community.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>The second level navigational terms were rather straightforward: for the most part, including the most common terms from the analyzed sites, as well as a few of the terms that had been included in primary navigation but we decided to move, got the job done. Some elements that were used sparingly as second level navigation were on the third level on other sites, and many of these were relegated to the third level on our site as well.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p> This is what we decided on for our primary navigation:</p>

	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>We looked at other homepage navigation elements in the analysis, as well:</p>
	</div>
	<img class="imagic" src="images/footer_ticker.png"></img>
	<div class="bodypara"><p>Every site had Social Media in the footer, so we were sure to include that. A full site map and a link to a site map each made an appearance:  we decided that a full site map below-the-fold is an elegant way of including it. Contact info in the footer is of course a convention.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bodypara"><p>Every site also had a News Feed of some kind (some had two) and most had Event Feeds, some with mostly text, some with mostly images, and some that incorporate both. These were better solutions than having these elements in primary navigation, so we incorporated that into our page. An embedded search bar on the homepage seemed like a good idea, too.
	</p>
	</div>
	<img class="imagic" src="images/second_level.png"><img>
	<img class="imagic" src="images/second_level2.png"><img>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>The top level of each second-level page was generally just a directory of the elements contained in the dropdown menu for navigation. However, several had some helpful information about which information you should look at first, tips to other things on the site that might help you get through that, and so on. Some pages chose to only have the top-level primary navigation available from each subpage, rather than the full dropdown. We discussed this decision and couldn't come up with any reasons not to have the full nav menu available. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>For most secondary pages, a strong tertiary navigation will be necessary, especially those for which the drop-down menu may not have been sufficient (Campus Life, for example, will have tons of stuff going on). Some, like we saw with Admissions, can get away with being more straightforward.</p>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<h2>Difficult Decisions</h2>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>We decided that Academics and Research warranted their spot in primary navigation, while most of the elements in Global (usually only two or three subpages) could fit in in Academics, while Donations could be dealt with w/ a dedicated button on the home page, which we eventually decided was best put up near the search bar. We also decided to use this space for links to parent, student, faculty, and alumni portals. Originally, we had been wary of including a second sort of navigation- organizing by content rather than by user type, because multiple users can be searching for common content, and we wanted to have a more strictly hierachical organization of navigation that would avoid making the mistakes the current UL site makes: confusing, intermingled navigation that lacks clear structure. Our eventual decision was to include the portals, but not have subcategories within the portal pages. This way, the distinction between the primary navigation and the user-specific portals would not lead to confusion. Aside from that, other important elements were Campus Life and Athletics - we decided to put Campus Life as a primary category. Athletics was harder to figure out how to deal with. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>	After some discussion, we decided to put Athletics as a subpage underneath Campus Life. However, to keep Athletics visible from the homepage, and thus easily accessible, it would also be given a homepage feed to cover upcoming athletic events, awards, and the like. This keeps athletics visible (on the homepage), accessible from anywhere on the site (via the Current Students dropdown) but does not require precious real estate on the primary navigation bar.

	The other topics that were only included in primary navigation sparingly during the competetive analysis, we decided to include as second-level navigation, or, in the case of "News," to deal with, again, by using a homepage feed.  BU did this very well so we decided to emulate them in this regard.</p>
	</div>
	<img class="imagic" src="images/athletic_feed.jpg"><img>
	<p class="caption">How we decided to deal with athletics and news without putting them in the nav bar</p>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>	Another decision was where to put financial aid. We discussed it for a while and it didn't really seem to fit under any particular category better than another. Eventually we decided to go with what the majority of competetive analysis sites had done, and put it under Admissions, though there were also solid arguments for inclusion elsewhere.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bodypara">
	<p>	Many of the decisions having to do with organization of navigation and placement of other elements were strongly influenced by our own experience using university pages, particularly UCSD's. For example, my own experience lead me to believe that things like Maps and Calendars are much more important than they generally get credit for, and they were both given secondary nav location despite not showing up frequently in the analysis. </p>

More importantly, the actions necessary on our site are much clearer and more obvious, reducing user errors and limiting frustration with the site.
